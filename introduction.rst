Unicorns

   Here's what a typical unicorn looks like. Note the single spiraling horn and the brilliant white coat.

Unicorns are highly elusive magical equine beasts known for their beauty, purity, and healing properties. Unlike the common horse, they have cloven hooves, a goat-like beard, a brilliant white coat, and, most notably, a single spiraling horn.

Whilst unicorn meat is (controversially) considered a delicacy by some, unicorns are most profitable for their horns, blood, and hair. These parts of the unicorn can be used in the construction of wands and the preparation of powerful enchantments and potions.

Specifically:

- *Unicorn horns* have tremendous healing properties and can be sold whole or in powdered form ready to be used in potion making. Unicorn horn is the primary ingredient in the well known *Antidote to Common Poisons* potion.
- *Unicorn blood* is known for its life-giving properties and can be drunk raw for extreme potency, or mixed into potions as needed.
- *Unicorn hair* is also used in some potions, but most commonly used as a wand core. Wands with a unicorn hair core are known for their consistency and faith to the wand bearer.

.. WARNING::
   It is said those who slay a unicorn are cursed for life. It is also said the blood of a slain unicorn, or potions prepared from the same, will curse you for life as soon as it touches your lips. The authors make no representations as to the accuracy of this information.

Goblin Technology
-----------------

There are two common ways to hunt magical beasts:

1. Train extensively, learning all the various techniques, spells, and enchantments needed to ensure success.
2. Purchase expensive magical objects that do most of the work for you.

These aren't our only options, however.

There is a vast array of goblin-made technology products on the market that can help you hunt unicorns. Goblin technology is abundant, being available in almost every auction house and from any goblin trading posts. And in addition, it is relatively inexpensive in comparison with gnome and dwarf technology.

Unfortunately, goblin technology is fairly unreliable and often comes with no warranty. Whether this makes sense for you will depend on your specific circumstances and requirements.

.. DANGER::
   Goblins are known for their fondness of explosives. When goblin technology malfunctions it usually does so with a bang, even when there's no logical reason for the device to have contained explosives. This can result in the rapid unscheduled disassembly of your equipment, or, if you are standing too close, yourself. Plan accordingly.
