Preparation
===========

Preparation is key if you want to ensure a successful hunting trip.

Equipment Acquisition
---------------------

There are three basic pieces of equpitment you'll need for hunting unicorns.

As unicorns are solitary creatures, and distrusting of non-magical beings, unless you are very lucky, a *lure* will be needed to attract a unicorn.

You cannot decamp anywhere near your lure, or the unicorn will notice you and not come close. And if you can see the unicorn, there's a good chance the unicorn can see you. For this reason, it's vital that you bring some sort of *detection system* with you.

Once a unicorn has been lured and detected, you can attempt to make the kill. Some sort of *long-range weapon* is useful for this.

We recommend:

- *Acme Lure Proâ„¢*
- *The Combo Radar and Alerting System 3000*
- *Goblin Rocket Launcher XXL*

Feel free to make your own product selections according to availability and budget, but as previously mentioned: goblin-made technology is not known for its reliability, so you'll want to make sure to check the reviews before purchasing.

The rest of this guide will assume you're using these products, but the instructions should be easy to adapt in case you're not.

Bait
----

Most technological lure systems require bait.

The basic principle is simple. The machine extracts and amplifies any of the bait's magical energy and radiates it into the surroundings. Because magical creatures are attracted to source of magic similar to their own, you can effectively lure any magical creature with a lesser, easier to catch, magical creature of the same type.

For our purposes, we're interested in:

- Bunny rabbits
- Butterflies
- Fairies and other forest sprites
- Fawns

All four can be caught by hand or bought pre-prepared.

Catching the first four in-situ is easy enough. Be sure to bring a rabbit trap, a net, and a few glass jars with you.

Fawns are tricker to catch, and it is recommended instead that you purchase fawn flanks at your local auction house or trading post.

Freshly caught or killed bait is preferable because it still retains most of its magic, making it much more effective as bait. But it's usually a good idea to bring some pre-prepared bait anyway, should you have difficulties catching bait on the day.

.. NOTE::
   If you're buying pre-prepared bunny rabbits, butterflies, or fawn flanks, be sure to buy the magical variety (i.e. sourced from an enchanted forest).

Location Selection
------------------

Unicorns typically inhabit enchanted forests. There should be one or more enchanted forests in your area. Check your local map for more information.

Some considerations:

* Goblin technology is prone to exploding unpredictably, especially when jostled. Lessen the chance of loss of life by choosing the easiest route (e.g. using paved roads) and try to keep your journey time as short as possible.
* Size is always a trade-off. The smallest enchanted forests are the safest, but also present the least opportunities for catching a unicorn. The largest are better hunting grounds, but often attract the most dangerous beasts and most powerful, malevolent magic.

.. TIP::
   Don't rely on the gossip in your local tavern. Check with your local lorekeeper before selecting a forest. This will cost a small fee, but the peace of mind is worth it knowing for sure what sorts of beasts and magic await you.
