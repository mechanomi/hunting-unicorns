Your First Hunt
===============

Okay. You've purchased your equipment from a reputable goblin stockist or local auction house. You've selected an enchanted forest and spoken to the appropriate lorekeeper. Perhaps you've even enlisted the help of a friend.

What's next?

Find a Good Spot
----------------

Assuming you've made it to the enchanted forest without blowing yourself up, your next challenge is to find a decent spot to set up camp.

You're looking for two important things:

1. A glade or clearing with a diameter of less than 40 meters. For some reason, unicorns are often found in such areas. You can use this to your advantage. They also have the benefit of making it easier to set up a detection system and target your ranged weapon.
2. A nearby area with good cover for hiding. Ideally, you will be totally hidden from the unicorn until the time comes to make the kill. The cover you select should make it as easy as possible to switch from cover to taking up aim.

.. TIP::
   Plan to get to the forest for sunrise and to leave before sundown. This will increase your ability to hunt safely. Most enchanted forests are not too much fun after dark.

Set Up The Detection System
---------------------------

The first thing you must do is set up the detection system.

*The Combo Radar and Alerting System 3000* comes with eight remote sensors which can easily be attached to trees and other surfaces.

Carefully unpack each sensor and check the phlogiston levels. Each sensor should be topped up with phlogiston so that they do not run out of power while you're waiting.

Once unpacked and topped up, carry the sensors, *carefully*, one by one, and install them onto the most appropriate trees around the glade or clearing. You want to get as much coverage as possible, so space them equidistantly if you can.

If the attached claw malfunctions, use some of the string or tape you brought with you to jury rig the sensor to the trunk.

Each remote sensor has a max range of 20 meters.

Once the sensors have been placed, return to your hideout and unpack the radar and alerting system. Switch it on, and select *Pair* from the main function menu. Wait for the device to detect and pair with each of the sensors before continuing.

If you find that one or more of the sensors isn't being detected, you may have to perform a hard reset of your sensors and detector system. If that still doesn't work, check the phlogiston levels. Else, consult the troubleshooting section of the device manual.

Set Up The Magical Lure
-----------------------

Now we've set up our detection system, we can set up the magical lure.

Return to the glade or clearing and, once again, *carefully*, place the Acme Magic Lure Proâ„¢ down in the centre. Check the phlogiston levels, and top up if necessary.

Switch the machine on and check the status light. If everything is working correctly, the light should be green.

Select your magical bait and place it in the transparent vessel located at the top of the machine.

.. DANGER::
   You must only use bait that is appropriate for unicorns. Night spores, for instance, are easily mistakable for forest sprites, but attract shadow prowlers instead of unicorns. If you doubt your identification skills, be sure to bring a portable bestiary with you.

Close the vessel lid and make sure the bait is secured, then switch the machine from *On* to *Active* using the rotary dial on the side. The light should start flashing blue. That means the machine is working and the magical lure is active.

You can now return to your hideout.

.. WARNING::
   If at any point the light on magical lure displays an unexpected colour, immediately consult the troubleshooting section of the device manual.

Wait and Monitor
----------------

You're back in your hideout, the magical lure is running, and your sensors are on, paired, and feeding data to your detection system.

Unpack your *Goblin Rocket Launcher XXL*, clean it *very carefully*, check the phlogiston levels, and load up one rocket. Then place the launcher somewhere handy.

Put the headphones on that came with your detection system, and wait.

If anything steps into the glade or clearing, you should hear a soft ping. Check the monitor. The display should tell you more about what has been detected. Expect most of the pings to be uninteresting animals.

If and when a unicorn does eventually appear, be prepared to strike swiftly. Unicorns are perceptive, nervous, and extremely fast.

Make The Kill
-------------

Okay, you've detected a unicorn.

This bit is easy.

Grab the rocket launcher, point it at the unicorn, and fire.

.. TIP::
   If your aim isn't so good, try homing missiles.
