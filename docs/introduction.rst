Unicorns
========

.. sidebar:: Visual appearance

   This exquisite illustration depicts the morphological details of a typical unicorn. Note the single spiraling horn and the brilliant white coat.

Unicorns are highly elusive magical equine beasts known for their beauty and healing properties. Unlike the common horse, they have cloven hooves, a goat-like beard, a brilliant white coat, and, most notably, a single spiraling horn.

While unicorn meat is (controversially) considered a delicacy, unicorns are most profitable for their horns, blood, and hair. You can use these parts of the unicorn to construct wands and prepare powerful enchantments and potions.

Specifically:

.. rst-class:: open

- *Unicorn horns* have excellent healing properties, and you can sell them whole or in a powdered form ready to be used in potion-making. Unicorn horn is the primary ingredient in the well-known *Antidote to Common Poisons* potion.

- *Unicorn blood* is known for its life-giving properties and can be consumed raw for extra potency or mixed into potions as needed.

- *Unicorn hair* can be used in some potions, but its most common use is as a wand core. Wands with a unicorn hair core are known for their reliability and loyalty to the wand bearer.

.. _intro-unicorns-curse:

.. WARNING::

   It is said that those who slay a unicorn are cursed for life. It is also said the blood of a slain unicorn or potions prepared from the same will curse you for life as soon as it touches your lips. The authors make no representations as to the accuracy of this information.


.. _intro-goblin-tech:

Goblin technology
=================

There are two common ways to hunt magical beasts:

1. Train extensively, learning all the various techniques, spells, and enchantments needed to ensure success.

2. Purchase expensive magical objects that do most of the work for you.

These aren't your only options, however.

There is a vast array of goblin-made technology products on the market that can help you hunt unicorns. Goblin technology is abundant, being available in almost every auction house and from any goblin trading post. And, in addition, it is relatively inexpensive in comparison to gnome and dwarf technology.

Unfortunately, goblin technology can be very unreliable and often comes with no warranty. Whether the risks posed by this are acceptable will depend on your specific circumstances and requirements.

.. _intro-goblin-explosives:

.. DANGER::

   Goblins are known for their fondness for explosives.

   When goblin technology malfunctions, it usually does so with a *BANG*â€”even when there is no logical reason for the device to have contained explosives in the first place. This sort of malfunction can result in the *rapid unscheduled disassembly* of your equipment or, if you are standing too close, yourself. Plan accordingly.
