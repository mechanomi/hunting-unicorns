   This harrowing crime-scene photo depicts the typical results at the site of rocket impact.

Congratulations. You *murdered* your first unicorn. Are you proud of yourself?

As noted in the first section, you are now :ref:`cursed for life <intro-unicorns-curse>` (probably).

However, as far as the authors know, unicorn curses are not cumulative. If this is true, and if you can live with yourself, you may as well make the most of it by murdering more unicorns now that you are a *unicorn murderer*.

Once you have come to terms with what you have done, collect all the raw unicorn materials you can gather. Fill the containers you brought, pack up your equipment, make your way home, and pray that your sins are forgivable.

The resources you acquired will sell for a high price at your local auction house, providing it is legal to trade in unicorn-derived goods where you live. We assume that you checked this important detail before embarking upon your expedition.

.. TODO::

   As some readers have thankfully pointed out, blowing up unicorns is not a particularly efficient way of harvesting their materials. Future editions of this handbook will address this shortcoming.
