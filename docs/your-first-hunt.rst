===============
Your first hunt
===============

Okay. You've :ref:`purchased your equipment <prep-equipment>` and :ref:`bait <prep-bait>` from a reputable goblin stockist or auction house. You've chosen an :ref:`enchanted forest <prep-location>` and spoken to the appropriate :ref:`lorekeeper <prep-location-lorekeeper>`. Perhaps you've even enlisted the help of a friend or mercenary.

What's next?


.. _first-hunt-camp:

Chose a camping spot
====================

Assuming you've made it to the enchanted forest without :ref:`blowing yourself up <intro-goblin-explosives>`, your next challenge is to find a decent spot to set up camp.

Your camp should be located as close as possible to the following:

.. rst-class:: open

1. *A glade or clearing with a diameter of fewer than 40 meters.*

   For some reason, these areas attract unicorns more frequently. Use this to your advantage. Conveniently, glades and clearings also make it easier (i.e., safer) to target your ranged weapon.

2. *An area with a good hiding cover.*

   Unicorns have excellent eyesight. Your cover should keep you *totally* hidden from view until the time comes to make the kill. Your cover should also make it as easy as possible to switch from taking cover to taking up aim.

.. _first-hunt-camp-daytime:

.. TIP::

   Plan to get to the forest for sunrise and to leave before sundown. Doing so will increase your ability to hunt safely. Most enchanted forests are not too much fun after dark.


.. _first-hunt-detection-system:

Set up the detection system
===========================

As your first task, you must set up your :ref:`unsupervised detection system <prep-equipment>`.

*The Combo Radar and Alerting System 3000* comes with eight remote sensors which can be easily attached to trees and other surfaces.

Carefully unpack each sensor and check the phlogiston levels. You should top up each sensor with phlogiston to help make sure they do not run out of power while you're waiting.

Once unpacked and topped up, carry the sensors—:ref:`carefully <intro-goblin-explosives>`—one by one and install them onto the most appropriate trees around the glade or clearing. You want as much coverage as possible, so space them equidistantly if you can.

If the *attachment claw* (see manual) malfunctions, use some of the :ref:`string, bubblegum, or tape <prep-equipment-pack>` you brought with you to improvise a solution.

Each remote sensor has a maximum range of 20 meters.

Once you have placed the sensors, return to your hiding cover and unpack the radar and alerting system. Switch it on, and select *Pair* from the main menu. Wait for the device to detect and pair with each of the sensors before continuing.

If your device fails to detect one or more sensors, you may have to perform a hard reset of your sensors and the detector system. Consult the *Troubleshooting* section of your device manual for more help.


.. _first-hunt-lure:

Set up the magical lure
=======================

With the unsupervised detection system set up, you can set up the :ref:`magical lure system <prep-bait>`.

Return to the glade or clearing and, once again—:ref:`carefully <intro-goblin-explosives>`—place the *Acme Magic Lure Pro™* down on the ground. As before, check the phlogiston levels, and top up if necessary.

Switch the machine to *On* using the rotary dial and check the status light on the side. If everything is working correctly, the light should be :ref:`green <first-hunt-lure-light>`.

Select your magical bait and place it in the transparent vessel located at the top of the machine.

.. _first-hunt-lure-bestiary:

.. DANGER::

   You must only use bait that is appropriate for unicorns. Night spores, for instance, are easily mistakable for forest sprites but attract shadow prowlers instead of unicorns. If you doubt your identification skills, be sure to bring a portable bestiary with you.

Ensure the bait is secured, close the vessel lid, and switch the machine from *On* to *Active*.

After a short delay, the status light should start :ref:`flashing blue <first-hunt-lure-light>`, signaling the successful start to the process of extracting the magical life energy from the (currently) living (and possibly sentient) creature trapped inside.

You can now return to your hideout.

.. _first-hunt-lure-light:

.. WARNING::

   If the status light on your lure displays an unexpected color at any point, consult the *Troubleshooting* section of the device manual *immediately*.


.. _first-hunt-wait:

Wait and monitor
================

You're back in your hideout, the magical lure system is running, and your sensors are on, paired, and feeding data to your unsupervised detection system.

Now, unpack the *Goblin Rocket Launcher XXL*, clean it :ref:`very carefully <intro-goblin-explosives>`, check the phlogiston levels, and load it with a single rocket.

Place the rocket launcher somewhere handy. Then, get comfortable, put the headphones on that came with your unsupervised detection system, and wait.

If anything steps into the glade or clearing, you should hear a soft ping. Check the detection monitor. The graphical display should tell you more about what the system has detected. Expect most of the pings to be uninteresting animals.

If and when a unicorn does eventually appear, be prepared to strike swiftly. Unicorns are perceptive, nervous, and extremely fast.


.. _first-hunt-murder:

Murder time
===========

Okay, you've detected a unicorn.

This bit's easy.

Grab the rocket launcher, point it at the thing you want to die, and press the *murder button* (also known as a "trigger").

.. _first-hunt-murder-aim:

.. TIP::

   If your aim is poor, try homing missiles.
