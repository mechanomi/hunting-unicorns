Preparation
===========

Preparation is vital if you want to ensure a successful hunting trip.

Equipment acquisition
=====================

There are three essential pieces of equipment you'll need for hunting unicorns:

.. rst-class:: open

1. Unicorns are solitary creatures and are distrusting of non-magical beings. Unless you are fortunate, you will need a *mechanical lure system* and some *magical lure* to attract one.

2. You cannot camp near your lure, or the unicorn will likely notice you and keep its distance. Remember: If you can see the unicorn, there's a good chance the unicorn can see you. For this reason, you will need some sort of *unsupervised detection system*.

3. Once you have lured and detected a unicorn, you can attempt to make the kill. Some sort of *long-range weapon* will be necessary for this.

For the above three requirements, we recommend:

- *Acme Magic Lure Pro™*
- *The Combo Radar and Alerting System 3000*
- *Goblin Rocket Launcher XXL*

Feel free to make your product selections according to availability and budget. As previously mentioned: goblin-made technology is :ref:`not known for its reliability <intro-goblin-explosives>`, so be sure to check the reviews before purchasing.

The rest of this guide will assume you're using the recommended products, but the instructions should work for most items.

.. _prep-equipment-pack:

.. TIP::

   Don't forget to pack:

   - Ammo (rockets or homing missiles)
   - A good supply of phlogiston to power your devices
   - Basic repair materials like string, bubblegum, and tape
   - Containers for carrying unicorn parts


.. _prep-bait:

Magical bait
============

.. sidebar:: Ethical considerations

   .. image:: _static/img/bunny-rabbit.png

   Some people argue it's morally okay to extract the magical life energy from animals like this because they don't have any feelings.

Mechanical lure systems, like the *Acme Magic Lure Pro™*, require *magical bait*.

The basic principle is as follows: The machine extracts and amplifies any of the bait's magical energy and radiates it into the surroundings. Because magical creatures are attracted to sources of magic similar to their own, you can effectively lure any magical creature with a lesser, easier-to-catch magical creature of the same type.

For unicorns, you can use any of the following:

- Bunny rabbits (the fluffier, the better)
- Butterflies
- Fairies and other forest sprites
- Fawns

You can catch all four by hand or buy them pre-prepared.

Catching the first three in-situ is easy enough. Be sure to bring a rabbit trap, a net, and a few glass jars with you.

Fawns are trickier to catch, and we recommend instead that you purchase fawn flanks at your local auction house or trading post.

Freshly caught bait is preferable because it still retains most of its magic, making it much more effective. However, it's usually a good idea to bring some pre-prepared bait, just in case you have difficulties catching bait on the day.

.. _prep-bait-buying:

.. NOTE::

   If you're buying pre-prepared bunny rabbits, butterflies, or fawn flanks, be sure to buy the magical variety (i.e., hand-sourced from an :ref:`enchanted forest <prep-location>`).


.. _prep-location:

Location selection
==================

Unicorns typically inhabit *enchanted forests*. There may be one or more enchanted forests in your area. Check your adventurer's map for more information.

Some important considerations:

.. rst-class:: open

- As mentioned previously, Goblin technology is :ref:`prone to exploding <intro-goblin-explosives>`, especially when jostled. Lessen the chance of loss of life by choosing the most accessible route (e.g., using paved roads) and trying to keep your journey time as short as possible.

- Size is always a trade-off. The smallest enchanted forests are the safest but also present the fewest opportunities for catching unicorns. The most extensive forests prove better hunting grounds but often attract the most dangerous beasts and most powerful, malevolent magic.

.. _prep-location-lorekeeper:

.. CAUTION::

   Don't rely on the gossip in your local tavern. Check with your local lorekeeper before selecting a forest. Consulting a lorekeeper may cost a small amount of gold, but for many people, the peace of mind is worth it, knowing for sure what sort of adventure awaits you.
